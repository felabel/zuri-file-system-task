# ZURI TRAINING TASK 4

#  A simple task that includes using node-fetch to fetch json data and writing it to a file

# node-fetch is a lightweight module that enables us to use the fetch() function in NodeJS, with very similar functionality as window.fetch() in native JavaScript

# Using nodejs
# install using npm install node-fetch
# require it in the file to be used using   --  const fetch = require('node-fetch) 
# here is the syntax;
# fetch(url, [options])
# the url parameter is simply the direct URL to the resource we wish to fetch, which is what i did in this task. It has to be an absolute URL or the function will throw an error. The optional options parameter is used when using use fetch() for anything other than a simple GET req
